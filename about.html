## About

My name is Sachit Bhat and I am from St. Louis, now studying computer science and economics at Vanderbilt University. I am constantly exposed to many seemingly disparate topics and concepts, yet
have developed a passion for these cross-disciplinary fields. I love diving into the inner workings of large scale projects and services, and strive to continue learning and growing.

I am very interested in product management and software engineering, and would like to work in the tech industry up graduation.
