## About

My name is Mira Baliga and I'm from Cupertino, California. I currently live in Maryland, where I attend the University of Maryland, College Park.

I'm a computer science major and Spanish minor. I wrote an <a href="https://www.edsurge.com/news/2016-01-08-what-it-really-takes-to-get-girls-like-me-to-code" target="_blank"><u>article</u></a> about how we can get more girls interested in programming, and I've lobbied Congress with the ACLU. I love <a href="http://www.mirabaliga.deviantart.com" target="_blank"><u>drawing</u></a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mirabaligaphotography/" target="_blank"><u>photography</u></a>.
