author_blurb: "As an undergraduate studying computer science and economics at Vanderbilt University, I have been exposed to many seemingly disparate topics and concepts, yet
have developed a passion for both cross-disciplinary fields. I love diving into the inner workings of large scale projects and services, and will continue to learn and grow as a thinker."
